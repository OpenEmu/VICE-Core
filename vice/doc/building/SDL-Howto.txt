Building the SDL port of VICE:

Building in *nix compile enviroments
------------------------------------

If you have checked out the unstable svn version of VICE you need to generate
the configure script first by doing:
./autogen.sh

The stable tarball already has the configure script, so continue with:

./configure --enable-sdlui
make
make install

You'll need the SDL libs and headers. For free scaling, the OpenGL is
also needed (libGL, opengl32.dll, ...). Movie recording needs the
FFMPEG libraries and headers.

Steps to set up the needed external SDL libs for building using with minGW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. You will need to download the current version of SDL headers and libs for minGW. 
   They can be found here https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.15-mingw32.tar.gz
2. Locate your minGW install include directory (ex. C:\MinGW\include), and
   create a directory called SDL there (ex. C:\MinGW\include\SDL). Inside this
   directory, copy all your SDL header (.h) files extracted in the SDL 'include' 
   directory from step #1
3. Locate your minGW library directory (ex. C:\MinGW\lib). Inside this directory, 
   copy all your SDL libs (.a) files extracted into the SDL 'lib' directory from step #1
4. Follow the standard build instructions for *nix environment now
5. After making, type 'make bindist' to create the binary distribution files. They 
   will appear in a newly created SDLVICE directory. 

NOTE: The default SDL build does not statically link the mingw and sdl runtime libs, 
so you will need to locate and copy the SDL.dll from found in step #1 and the minGW 
libstdc++.dll & libgcc.dll files from the minGW (ex. C:\MinGW\bin) directory to a global
windows path (ex. \WINDOWS\system32) or you can just drop them in the local SDLVICE 
binary dir so they can be found during runtime.

Building in Visual Studio
-------------------------

To build SDL VICE in Windows with Visual C/C++, you will need to get the VC SDL
headers and libraries (http://www.libsdl.org/).

Once you have downloaded the VC SDL headers and libraries you need to make a
directory for them to reside in, you can do this in the following way:

- Make an SDL_dev directory and inside that directory make two new directories, one
  called SDL (for the headers) and one called SDL_libs (for the libraries).
- Move the files from the include directory of the downloaded SDL VC file to the
  SDL_dev/SDL directory.
- Move the files from the lib directory of the downloaded SDL VC file to the
  SDL_dev/libs directory.

Now you need to configure your VC to use those directories to find the
headers and libraries, you can do this in the following way:

- Start your Visual C/C++.
- Go to the menu 'tools' and click on the item 'options'.
- In the dialog window click on the tab 'directories'.
- For 'Include files' add the path to SDL_dev to the list.
- For 'Library files' add the path to SDL_dev/libs to the list.

From now on your VC will be set up to search through these directories for
the headers and libraries.

Now you can open the vice.dsw file and compile VICE.

To make a binary distribution directory after a compile of VICE you can
use the 'make-bindist.bat' file.
