Vice on Windows - The Next G(TK)eneration
=========================================

This is some quick instructions on getting Vice with the GTK3 GUI compiled on Windows under MinGW.

1. Get msys2 (includes mingw):
http://www.msys2.org/
Install as per that webpage, but don't bother with step 7 (GIT), unless you actually want GIT.


2. Install the stuff you actually need to build vice:
NOTE - this assumes you installed the 64 bit version of msys2...

Launch MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit and run the following to install your prerequisites:
$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain base-devel
(Hit enter for default on all the prompts, then wait for the 300MB of stuff to download and install.)

Get ntldd to help create the distribution:
$ pacboy sync ntldd

You might also want SVN to get/manage the source (or you could use a gui like e.g. TortoiseSVN):
$ pacman -S subversion

To checkout the source with SVN (e.g. to ~/vicetrunk/ ) you could then use:
$ svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk vicetrunk


3. You need the xa 6502 compiler which you will have to download and install:
http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/
Download, unpack to e.g.:
C:\msys64\home\user\xa-2.3.8
Then at the msys prompt e.g.:
$ cd ~/xa-2.3.8
$ make
$ make install


4. Now you can try to build Vice:
Note the below assumes your source is in c:\src\vice\
At the MSYS2 prompt run:
$ cd /c/src/vice/vice
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-native-gtk3ui
$ make
$ make bindist

NOTE if you want to help us out with bug reports, please instead configure with:
$ ./configure --enable-native-gtk3ui --enable-debug-gtk3ui --enable-debug


5. If it got through all those steps you should have some executables to play with in ..\vice\vice\GTK3VICE-3.*

Enjoy!
