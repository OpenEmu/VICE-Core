note: visual studio 2010 express is the last release that can be used without
      time restrictions and without having to register at microsoft. if you
      want to keep using it even though you installed other (newer) releases of
      visual studio, you will run into problem(s).

- if you get "fatal error LNK1123" after compilation, the problem is that you
  installed either a new compiler and/or an incompatible .net framework - see
  here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/7dz62kfh(v=vs.100).aspx

  some websites suggest to install service pack 1 for visual studio 2010 - this
  *does* solve the problem itself, but it will also convert vs2010 express into
  a 30 days trial version.

  alternatively, you may copy cvtres.exe from the newer install into the tree
  of vs2010 - it should solve the problem as well.
