<H1><A NAME="SEC271" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC271">12  Monitor</A></H1>

<P>
Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the "Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that in some
ports you have to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as
<CODE>rxvt</CODE> or <CODE>xterm</CODE>) in order to use the monitor.

<H2><A NAME="SEC272" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC272">12.1  Terminology</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`address_space'</SAMP>
<DD>
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of registers.
This can be the addresses available to the computer's processor, the
disk drive's processor or a specific memory configuration of one of
the mentioned processors.

<DT><SAMP>`bankname'</SAMP>
<DD>
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16 bit
address bus. The C64 and other computers have more than this amount,
and this is handled by banking: a memory address can have different
contents, depending on the active memory bank.
A bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

<DT><SAMP>`register'</SAMP>
<DD>
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

<DT><SAMP>`address'</SAMP>
<DD>
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

<DT><SAMP>`address_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses
must be in the same address space.

<DT><SAMP>`address_opt_range'</SAMP>
<DD>
An address or an address range.

<DT><SAMP>`label'</SAMP>
<DD>
<CODE>label</CODE> is the name of a label. It must start with a dot (".")
in order for the monitor to recognize it as a label. Register names preceeded
by a dot (for example <CODE>.PC</CODE>) are special labels that evaluate to value of
the respective register at the time it is used, and thus can not be used as
a regular label.

<DT><SAMP>`prompt'</SAMP>
<DD>
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second part
of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

<DT><SAMP>`checkpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an action
when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of
checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

<DT><SAMP>`breakpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

<DT><SAMP>`tracepoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

<DT><SAMP>`watchpoint'</SAMP>
<DD>
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.  When
a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

<DT><SAMP>`memmap'</SAMP>
<DD>
The memmap keeps track of RAM/ROM/IO read/write/execute
accesses. The feature must be enabled with "--enable-cpuhistory"
configure option, as it might decrease performance notably on
slower hardware. The option also enables CPU history.

<DT><SAMP>`&#60;...&#62;'</SAMP>
<DD>
A data type.

<DT><SAMP>`*'</SAMP>
<DD>
Zero or more occurrences.

<DT><SAMP>`[...]'</SAMP>
<DD>
An optional argument.

<H2><A NAME="SEC275" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC275">12.4  Assembly commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>a &#60;address&#62; [ &#60;instruction&#62; [: &#60;instruction&#62;]* ]</CODE>
<DD>
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line to
exit assembly mode).

<DT><CODE>disass [&#60;address&#62; [&#60;address&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>d [&#60;address&#62; [&#60;address&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are
used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is
treated as the start address and a default number of instructions are
disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number of
instructions are disassembled from the dot address.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC276" HREF="vice_toc.html#TOC276">12.5  Checkpoint commands</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>break [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid checkpoints
are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is set for that
address and the breakpoint number is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor breaks on "exec".
A conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

<DT><CODE>enable &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>disable &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

<DT><CODE>command &#60;checknum&#62; "&#60;command&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
When checkpoint <CODE>checknum</CODE> is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the <CODE>x</CODE> command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

<DT><CODE>condition &#60;checknum&#62; if &#60;cond_expr&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>cond &#60;checknum&#62; if &#60;cond_expr&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignored.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is
examined, not when the condition is set.

Currently, the cond_expr is very limited. You can use registers (.A, .X,
.Y, .PC, and .SP) and compare against other registers or absolute
values. For example, the following are all valid conditions:
.A == 0, .X == .Y, 8:.X == .X, .A != 5, .A &#60; .X.

However, you cannot specify memory contents and compare that.

<DT><CODE>delete &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>del &#60;checknum&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Delete the specified checkpoint.

<DT><CODE>ignore &#60;checknum&#62; [&#60;count&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no count is
given, the default value is 1.

<DT><CODE>trace [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>tr [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the <CODE>break</CODE> command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by
not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user an
execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to specify
the end of an range of addresses to be traced.
If no addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine which operation the
monitor traces. If not specified, the monitor traces all operations.
A conditional expression can also be specified for the tracepoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

<DT><CODE>until [&#60;address&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>un [&#60;address&#62;]</CODE>
<DD>
If no address is given, the currently valid breakpoints are printed.
If an address is given, a temporary breakpoint is set for that address
and the breakpoint number is printed.  Control is returned to the
emulator by this command.  The breakpoint is deleted once it is hit.

<DT><CODE>watch [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>w [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if &#60;cond_expr&#62;]]</CODE>
<DD>
This command is similar to the <CODE>break</CODE> command except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from a breakpoint by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of addresses.
If no addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor breaks on "load" and
"store" operations.
A conditional expression can also be specified for the watchpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

<DD>
<DT><CODE>al &#60;address&#62; &#60;label&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when entering
assembly code and is shown during disassembly.  Additionally, it can
be used whenever an address must be specified.

&#60;label&#62; is the name of the label; it must start with a dot (".") in
order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

<DT><CODE>delete_label [&#60;address_space&#62;] &#60;label&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>dl [&#60;address_space&#62;] &#60;label&#62;</CODE>

<DT><CODE>ll [&#60;address_space&#62;] "&#60;filename&#62;"</CODE>
<DD>
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no address
space is specified, the default readspace is used.

The file must contain commands the monitor understands, e.g. add_label. The
compiler cc65 can create such label files.

Vice can also load label files created by the Acme assembler. Their syntax is
e.g. "labelname = $1234 ; Maybe a comment". A dot will be added automatically
to label names assigned in this way to fit to the Vice label syntax. Normally
the semicolon seperates commands but after an assignment of this kind it may be
used to start a comment to end of line, so unchanged Acme label files can be
fed into Vice.
