"novte" is a stripped down library based on vte-0.52.2

the purpose of the resulting code is to be used for the ml monitor in VICE, and
to do that in a portable way that would work on all GTK3 targets.

what was removed from VTE:

- everything that deals with regular expressions, and thus the need for libpcre2
- all support for pty, and the requirement for termios
- gnutls support, and warning about no support

- in vteseq.cc reporting screen size is disabled in seq_window_manipulation
  (uses deprecated gdk functions and doesnt seem to be mission critical)

- in vterowdata.h there are some static asserts which apparently fail when
  building on window (?) and thus are disabled for the time being

- in VteTerminalPrivate::seq_checksum_rectangular_area in vteseq.cc a couple
  feed_child() calls have been removed. probably the whole function is defunct.

- in VteTerminalPrivate::im_commit in vte.cc a feed_child_using_modes call has
  been removed. probably the whole function is defunct.

- in VteTerminalPrivate::change_color in vteseq.cc a feed_child() call has been 
  removed. probably the whole function is defunct.
  
- VteTerminalPrivate::seq_device_status_report in vteseq.cc is defunct.
- VteTerminalPrivate::seq_dec_device_status_report in vteseq.cc is defunct.

- more removed functions:
    vte_get_features, vte_get_major_version, vte_get_minor_version,
    vte_get_micro_version, vte_get_user_shell
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

right now the use of this "novte" replacement is forced, if you want for some
reason check if things work/behave different with real vte, remove the
"#define USE_NOVTE" things at the top of the following files:

src/arch/gtk3/linenoise.c
src/arch/gtk3/uimon.c
src/arch/gtk3/uimon-fallback.c

this stuff should get removed at some point and "novte" forced always

- uimon code should then use the novte_ functions instead of macros for them

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODOs and FIXMEs:

- vtetypes.hh "smartfd" - what is it used for? it needs to be fixed, or removed

- a bunch of functions call vte_... in vteterminal.h should get renamed to
  novte_... also some defines should get renamed from VTE_... to NOVTE_...

- some files use deprecated GValueArray and should use GArray instead: 
  matcher.cc matcher.hh table.cc table.hh vteinternal.hh

  GLIB_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS has been defined at the top of a couple of
  files that make use of this.

- there is still a lot of features/functionality that doesnt make a lot of sense 
  for what we are doing here.
