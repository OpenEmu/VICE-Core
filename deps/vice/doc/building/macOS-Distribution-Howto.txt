Binary Distribution:
--------------------

#
# Please note that the result will not run on an older version of macOS.
# It remains to be tested whether building on an older macOS results in
# a build that will run on a newer version of macOS.
#
# The binary distributions are not currently signed with an Apple developer ID
# and therefore not that easy to run on other macs due to gatekeeper. It is
# expected that this will get even harder in macOS 10.15 so we'll need to
# address this issue soon. The solution will likely look like passing the name
# of a signing identity to configure and using the codesign util to sign each
# app.
#
# First, create an SDL2 or GTK3 build. For compatibility with other systems you
# should build with --enable-arch=no passed to configure.
#

brew install platypus

#
# And then it's just:
#

make bindistzip

#
# Or to just make a bindist folder:
#

make bindist
