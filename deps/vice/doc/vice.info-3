16.10 The P00 image format
==========================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

These files were created for use in the PC64 emulator, written by
Wolfgang Lorenz.  Each one has the same layout with the filetype being
stored in the DOS extension (i.e.  Pxx is a PRG, Sxx is a SEQ, Uxx is a
USR and Rxx is a RELative file), and the header is only 26 bytes long.

This is a dump of a Pxx file (PRG)...

           00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
           -----------------------------------------------
     0000: 43 36 34 46 69 6C 65 00 43 52 49 53 49 53 20 4D
     0010: 4F 55 4E 54 41 49 4E 00 00 00

Bytes                  Description
$00-$06                ASCII string "C64File"
$07                    Always $00
$08-$17                Filename in PETASCII, padded with $00 (not $A0,
                       like a D64)
$18                    Always $00
$19                    REL file record size ($00 if not a REL file)
$1A-??                 Program data

The 'xx' in the extension of the file is usually 00, except when we have
two DOS filenames which would be the same, but the C64 filenames are
different!  If we have two C64 filenames which are the same, they
*cannot* co-exist in the same directory.  If we have two files which do
convert down to be the same DOS filename, the extension is incremented
until an unused one is found (x01, x02, x03, up to x99).  We can have up
to 99 different C64 files with the same corresponding DOS names as
that's all the extension will hold (from P00 to P99).

Each PC64 file only has one entry, there are no multi-file containers
allowed.  This could result in a large number of these files in a
directory, even for only a few programs, as each C64 file will result in
a PC64 file entry.  The best use for a PC64 file is a single-file
program, one which does not load anything else.

16.11 The CRT cartridge image format
====================================

This chapter is based on CRT.txt (rev1.14) compiled by Peter Schepers,
with additional contributions from Per Hakan Sundell, Markus Brenner,
Marco Van Den Heuvel, Groepaz.

Cartridge files were introduced in the CCS64 emulator, written by Per
Hakan Sundell, and use the ".CRT" file extension.  This format was
created to handle the various ROM cartridges that exist, such as Action
Replay, the Power cartridge, and the Final Cartridge.

Normal game cartridges can load into several different memory ranges
($8000-9FFF, $A000-BFFF or $E000-FFFF). Newer utility and freezer
cartridges were less intrusive, hiding themselves until called upon, and
still others used bank-switching techniques to allow much larger ROM's
than normal.  Because of these "stealthing" and bank-switching methods,
a special cartridge format was necessary, to let the emulator know where
the cartridge should reside, the control line states to enable it and
any special hardware features it uses.

From the above chart, the following table can be built.  It shows
standard cartridges, either 8K or 16K in size, and the memory ranges
they load into.

     Type     Size   Game   EXRom  Low Bank  High Bank
              in K   Line   Line    (ROML)    (ROMH)
     -------------------------------------------------
     Normal    8k     hi     lo     $8000      ----
     Normal    16k    lo     lo     $8000     $A000
     Ultimax   8k     lo     hi     $E000      ----

The ROMH and ROML lines are CPU-controlled status lines, used to bank
in/out RAM, ROM or I/O, depending on what is needed at the time.

Ultimax cartridges typically are situated in the $E000-FFFF (8K) ROM
address range.  There are some cartridges which only use 4K of the 8K
allocation.  If the cartridge is 16K in size, then it will reside in
both $8000-9FFF and $E000-FFFF.

This cart has 32Kb of ROM, and 8Kb of RAM. The bank switching is done by
writing to the I/O-1 range as follows:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
         6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
         5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
                  I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
         4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
         3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
         2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
         1    1 = /EXROM high
         0    1 = /GAME low

Additionally the RAM or ROM can be available through a window in the
I/O-2 range.

A total of 64 kB of ROM memory is organized into four $4000 banks
located at $8000-$BFFF.

The banks are arranged in the following way:

         Bank 0:  BASIC, Monitor, Disk-Turbo
         Bank 1:  Notepad, BASIC (Menu Bar)
         Bank 2:  Desktop, Freezer/Print
         Bank 3:  Freezer, Compression

The cartridges uses the entire I/O-1 and I/O-2 range.  Bank switching is
done by writing the bank number plus $40 into memory location $DFFF. For
instance, to select bank 2, $DFFF is set to $42.

The CRT file contains four CHIP blocks, each block with a start address
of $8000, length $4000 and the bank number in the bank field.  In the
cartridge header, both EXROM ($18) and GAME ($19) are set to 1 to enable
the 16 kB ROM configuration.

The registers are arranged in the following way:

One register at $DFFF:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         7      Hide this register (1 = hidden)
         6      NMI line  (0 = low = active) *1)
         5      GAME line  (0 = low = active) *2)
         4      EXROM line (0 = low = active)
         2-3    unassigned (usually set to 0)
         0-1    number of bank to show at $8000

1) if either the freezer button is pressed, or bit 6 is 0, then an NMI
is generated

2) if the freezer button is pressed, GAME is also forced low

The rest of I/O-1/I/O-2 contain a mirror of the last 2 pages of the
currently selected ROM bank (also at $dfff, contrary to what some other
documents say)

Simons' BASIC permanently uses 16 kB ($4000) bytes of cartridge memory
from $8000-$BFFF. However, through some custom bank-switching logic the
upper area ($A000-$BFFF) may be disabled so Simons' BASIC may use it as
additional RAM. Writing a value of $01 to address location $DE00 banks
in ROM, $00 disables ROM and enables RAM.

The CRT file contains two CHIP blocks of length $2000 each, the first
block having a start address of $8000, the second block $A000.  In the
cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1 to
indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

($2000) at $8000-$9FFF. There are 16 banks of ROM memory and are
referenced by the following values:

         $00 -> Bank 0
         $08 -> Bank 1
         $10 -> Bank 2
         $18 -> Bank 3
         $20 -> Bank 4
         $28 -> Bank 5
         $30 -> Bank 6
         $38 -> Bank 7
         $01 -> Bank 8
         $09 -> Bank 9
         $11 -> Bank 10
         $19 -> Bank 11
         $21 -> Bank 12
         $29 -> Bank 13
         $31 -> Bank 14
         $39 -> Bank 15

The bank field in the chip headers is set according to the value written
to $DE00.  The following bits are used for bank decoding in $DE00 (0
being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

             Bit# 76543210
                  xx210xx3

After copying memory from the ROM banks, the selection program writes a
value of $86 to $DE00.  This seems either to reset or disable the
cartridge ROM.

The Super Games cartridge uses 4 16Kb banks ($8000-$BFFF) of ROM memory.
Bank selecting is done by writing to $DF00.

$DF00 register is as follows:

         bit   meaning
         ---   -------
          0    bank bit 0
          1    bank bit 1
          2    mode (0 = EXROM/GAME (bridged on the same wire - 16k config)
                     1 = cartridge disabled)
          3    write-protect-latch  (1 = no more changes are possible until
                                         the next hardware-reset )
         4-7   unused

This cart has 32Kb of ROM and 8Kb of RAM

Writing to I/O-1 will do the following:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
         6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
         5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
                  I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
         4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
         3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
         2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
         1    1 = /EXROM high
         0    1 = /GAME low

If bit 5 (RAM enable) is 1, bit 0,1 (exrom/game) is == 2 (cart off), bit
2,6,7 (cart disable, freeze clear) are 0, then cart ROM (Bank 0..3) is
mapped at 8000-9FFF, and cart RAM (Bank 0) is mapped at A000-BFFF and
cart RAM (Bank 0) is is enabled in the I/O-2 area using 16Kb game
config.

The cart RAM or ROM is available through a window in the I/O-2 range.

The Epyx FastLoad cart uses a simple capacitor to toggle the ROM on and
off:

the capacitor is discharged, and 8k game config enabled, by either
reading ROML or reading I/O-1.  If none of those accesses happen the
capacitor will charge, and if it is charged (after 512 cycles) then the
ROM will get disabled.

         Last Ninja Remix  (System 3)   (512 kB)
         Myth              (System 3)   (512 kB)

ROM memory is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF.
Bank switching is done by writing to address $DE00+X, where X is the
bank number (STA $DE00,X). For instance, to read from bank 3, address
$DE03 is written to.  Reading from anywhere in the I/O-1 range will
disable the cart.

The CRT file contains a string of CHIP blocks, each block with a start
address of $8000, length $2000 and the bank number in the bank field.
In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1
to enable the 8 kB ROM configuration.

After RESET or POWER ON, 16kB of cartridge ROM is visible at
$8000-$BFFF. Additionally, ROM normally located at $9E00-$9FFF is
mirrored into I/O-1 and I/O-2 at $DE00-$DFFF. ROM at $8000-$BFFF is
disabled by writing into the I/O-2 area (typically $DF00) and may be
re-enabled by writing into I/O-1 ($DE00).  However, the $DE00-$DFFF
(I/O-1/I/O-2) area itself always remains mapped to cartridge ROM.

The (Super) Zaxxon carts use a 4Kb ($1000) ROM at $8000-$8FFF (mirrored
in $9000-$9FFF) along with two 8Kb ($2000) cartridge banks located at
$A000-$BFFF. One of the two banks is selected by doing a read access to
either the $8000-$8FFF area (bank 0 is selected) or to $9000-$9FFF area
(bank 1 is selected).  EXROM ($18 = $00) and GAME ($19 = $00) lines are
always pulled to GND to select the 16 kB ROM configuration.

The CRT file includes three CHIP blocks:
         a) bank = 0, load address = $8000, size = $1000
         b) bank = 0, load address = $A000, size = $2000
         c) bank = 1, load address = $A000, size = $2000

This cartridge type is very similar to the OCEAN cart type: ROM memory
is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF. Bank switching
is done by writing the bank number to $DE00.  Deviant from the Ocean
type, bit 7 is cleared for selecting one of the ROM banks.  If bit 7 is
set ($DE00 = $80), the GAME/EXROM lines are disabled, turning on RAM at
$8000-$9FFF instead of ROM.

In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1
to indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 1 2764 (8Kb) which holds the base
eprom with the base menu, and 2 27256 eproms of which 8Kb parts are
banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00.  The following bits are
used for bank decoding in $DE00 (0 being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

              Bit# 76543210
                   xx10xx32

Any bank value below 4 or above 11 switches in the base bank (bank 0).

The bit values for each eprom bank are :

         eprom bank 1 : xx00xx01
         eprom bank 2 : xx01xx01
         eprom bank 3 : xx10xx01
         eprom bank 4 : xx11xx01
         eprom bank 5 : xx00xx10
         eprom bank 6 : xx01xx10
         eprom bank 7 : xx10xx10
         eprom bank 8 : xx11xx10

Setting bit 7 high will switch off EXROM.

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 8 8Kb banks of which the first holds
the base menu, the other eproms can be banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00.  Each low bit is used to
bank in the respective eprom.  If all bits are high then the EXROM is
switched off.

The bit values for each eprom bank is:

         eprom bank 1 : 11111110 ($FE) (base eprom)
         eprom bank 2 : 11111101 ($FD)

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 9 eprom sockets, of which the first
holds the base eprom with the base menu which is an 8Kb eprom, the other
eprom sockets can handle 8Kb, 16Kb or 32Kb eproms, of which 8kb can be
banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DFA0.  Bits 2, 1 and 0
determine which socket is used and bits 5 and 4 are used to select an
8Kb piece of the eprom.

The possible values for bits 5 and 4 for the (extra) eprom banks are:

          8Kb        : 3, 2, 1, 0

         16Kb bank 0 : 2, 0
         16Kb bank 1 : 3, 1

         32Kb bank 0 : 0
         32Kb bank 1 : 1
         32Kb bank 2 : 2
         32Kb bank 3 : 3

Reading from $DFC0 switches off the EXROM. Reading from $DFE0 switches
on the EXROM.

This cart has 32Kb of ROM, bank 0 is in the cart image but is unused.
The first 8Kb of the cart image is unused, the second 8Kb of the cart
image is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, the third 8Kb of the cart image is
mapped to $8000-$9FFF and the fourth 8Kb of the cart image is mapped to
$A000-$BFFF. An NMI can be triggered by the cart, if address $0001 is
written to and the cartridge is enabled.  The cart can be disabled by
software, by clearing bit 4 when writing to $DF00-$DFFF. Cart ROM at
$E000-$FFFF can be disabled by setting bit 5 to 0 when writing to
$DF00-$DFFF. Cart ROM at $8000-$BFFF can be disabled by setting bit 6 to
1 when writing to $DF00-$DFFF. Bit 7 of a byte written to $DF00-$DFFF
can be read back from the cartridge if enabled (like a memory cell).

The control register is the I/O-1 range:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    Eprom banking bit 0 (bank address 13)
         1    Controls the GAME line (0 sets GAME low, 1 sets GAME high)
         2    Freeze-end bit (disables the register and hides any rom bank)
         3    Controls the Exrom line (1 sets EXROM low, 0 sets EXROM high)
         4    Eprom banking bit 1 (bank address 14)
         5-7  Unused

The first page of the currently banked ROM block can be read in the
I/O-2 range.

This cart has 16Kb of ROM, of which the first 8Kb is mapped in at
$8000-$9FFF and the second 8Kb is used as a kernel replacement.  The
kernel replacement is achieved by a clip that needs to be installed
inside the C64.

Reading from I/O-1 causes a capacitor to get charged with every read,
once the capacitor is charged enough it switches the cart on.

Reading from I/O-2 causes a different capacitor to get charged with
every read, once the capacitor is charged enough it switched the cart
off.

EasyFlash is a 1 MByte Flash EPROM card with multiple configurations and
banks possible, it also has 256 bytes of RAM which is mapped into the
I/O-2 range.

There are two control registers, one at $DE00 and one at $DE02.

The register at $DE00 does the following:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         7    LED control
         6-3  Unused
         2    Mode (0/1)
         1    Exrom line control
         0    Game line control

The register at $DE02 controls which bank is mapped into ROMH and ROML.

This cart has 8Kb of ROM which is mapped to $E000, and 8Kb of RAM which
is mapped to $6000.  The cartridge is disabled after a reset.

When the freeze button is pressed the following happens:

   * an NMI is generated
   * as soon as the current adress is in bank 0xfe the cart switches to
     ultimax mode.  The cart ROM then contains one page full of "jmp
     $eaea", which ultimately calls the freezer code.
   * the $FFF7/$FFF8 "register" logic is enabled and any access (read or
     write) to $FFF7 will turn the cart_enabled off (leave ultimax
     mode), and an access to $FFF8 will turn the cart back on (enter
     ultimax mode).  the "register logic" that causes this can only be
     disabled again by a hardware reset.

Note: When the Cartridge Hardware Subtype/Revision (Offset 0x1A in the
CRT Header) is 1, then the image utilizes features only present in the
"Nordic Replay" (see description of Nordic/Atomic Power)

The Retro Replay has three registers: Two write-only ($DE00 & $DE01) and
one read-only register ($DE00 & $DE01 giving the same results).

The register at $DE00 is reset to $00 on a hard reset if not in flash
mode.  If in flash mode, it is set to $02 in order to prevent the
computer from starting the normal cartridge.  Flash mode is selected
with a jumper.

Register at $DE00:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    Controls the GAME line: A 1 asserts the line, a 0  will  deassert
              it.
         1    Controls the EXROM line: A 0 will assert it, a  1  will  deassert
              it.
         2    Writing a 1 will disable further write accesses to all  registers
              of the Retro Replay, and  set  the  memory  map  of  the  C64  to
              standard, as if there is no cartridge installed at all.
         3    Controls bank-address 13 for ROM and RAM banking.
         4    Controls bank-address 14 for ROM and RAM banking.
         5    Switches between ROM and RAM: 0=ROM, 1=RAM
         6    Must be written once to "1" after a successful freeze in order to
              set the correct memory map and  enable  bits  0  and  1  of  this
              register. Otherwise no effect.
         7    Controls bank-address 15 for ROM banking.

The register at $DE01 is the extended control register.  If not in Flash
mode, bits 1, 2 and 6 can only be written once.  If in Flash mode, the
REUcomp bit cannot be set, but the register will not be disabled by the
first write.  Bit 5 is always set to 0 if not in Flash mode.

Register at $DE01:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    Enable clockport connector.
         1    AllowBank (1 allows banking of RAM in $DF00/$DE02 area)
         2    NoFreeze (1 disables Freeze function)
         3    Bank-address 13 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
         4    Bank-address 14 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
         5    Bank-address 16 for ROM (only in flash mode)
         6    REU compatibility bit. 0=standard memory map, 1 = REU  compatible
              memory map
         7    Bank-address 15 for ROM (mirror of $DE00)

Reading from the registers at either $DE00 or $DE01 will return the
content of the status register.

Status register:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    1=Flashmode active (jumper set)
         1    feedback of AllowBank bit
         2    1=Freeze button pressed
         3    feedback of banking bit 13
         4    feedback of banking bit 14
         5    feedback of banking bit 16
         6    1=REU compatible memory map active
         7    feedback of banking bit 15

The following memory maps are available:

   * standard - $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active, $DF00-$DFFF
     contain the last page of the selected 8Kb bank of either ROM or
     RAM, whatever is selected.  RAM can only be accessed in
     $8000-$9FFF. ROM can be mapped to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the
     corresponding status on GAME and EXROM.

     Note: If the AllowBank bit is not set, the $DF00-$DFFF area will
     always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older cartridge images will
     work.  The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror
     in that area.

   * Freeze - ROM is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, bank 0 is active directly
     after Freeze.  Writing to bits 0 and 1 of the $DE00 register will
     have no effect on GAME and EXROM. RAM can be selected and used in
     $DF00 or $DE02, respectively, but not in $8000.  Banking bits work,
     so you have full read access to the ROM, and access to up to four
     RAM pages with the AllowBank bit set (minus 2 bytes if REU
     compatible bit is set).  You should leave this memory map ASAP by
     setting bit 6 of $DE00, because C64 RAM in the $E000 area is not
     available, and you don't have control of the GAME and EXROM lines.

   * REU compatible - $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active, $DE02-$DEFF
     contain a mirror of $9E02-$9EFF of the selected 8K-bank of either
     ROM or RAM, whatever is selected.  RAM can only be accessed in
     $8000-$9FFF. ROM can be mapped to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the
     corresponding status on GAME and EXROM. The $DF00 stays free for
     use with the 1764 Ram Expansion Unit (REU).

     Note: If the AllowBank bit is not set, the $DE02-$DEFF area will
     always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older cartridge images will
     work.  The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror
     in that area.

The clockport registers of this cart can be switched to either
$DE01-$DE0F or $DF21-$DF2F. The control registers are available at
$DF10-$DF13.

The register at $DE01 / $DF21 is write only:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         7-1  Unused
         0    0 = disable clock port, 1 = enable clockport

The registers at $DE02-$DE0F / $DF22-$DF2F are for the clock port and
are read/write.

The register at $DF10 is the MMC64 SPI transfer register, a byte written
to this registers is sent to the card & response from the card is read
here.

The register at $DF11 is the MMC64 control register:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    0 = MMC64 BIOS active, 1 = external ROM active
         1    0 = card selected, 1 = card not selected
         2    0 = 250khz transfer, 1 = 8mhz transfer
         3    0 = clock port @ $DE00, 1 = clock port @ $DF20
         4    0 = normal Operation, 1 = flash mode (*)
         5    0 = allow external rom when BIOS is disabled,
              1 = disable external ROM
         6    0 = SPI write trigger mode, 1 = SPI read trigger mode
         7    0 = MMC64 is active, 1 = MMC64 is completely disabled (**)

(*) bit can only be programmed when flash jumper is set (**) bit can
only be modified after unlocking

The register at $DF12 is the MMC64 status register, which is read-only:

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    0 = SPI ready, 1 = SPI busy
         1    external GAME line
         2    external EXROM line
         3    0 = card inserted, 1 = no card inserted
         4    0 = card write enabled, 1 = card write disabled
         5    0 = flash jumper not set, 1 = flash jumper set
         6-7  unused

The register at $DF13 is the MMC64 identification register, which when
reading from it can have the following values:

$64 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 0.  $01 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV A
hardware is used.  $02 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV B hardware is
used.

when writing to it it can be used to unlock bit 7 of $DF11 or to
re-enable the cart:

Write $55 & $AA into this register to unlock bit 7 of $DF11.  Write $0A
& $1C into this register to re-enable MMC64 hardware.

         4    bank address 14 (mirror of $DE00)
         5    0 = enable MMC registers, 1 = disable MMC registers. Can only  be
              written when bit 6 of $DF12 is 1. Register becomes effective when
              bit 0 of $DF11 is 1.
         6    0 = RAM/ROM at $DFxx, 1 = RAM/ROM at $DExx
         7    bank address 15 (mirror of $DE00)

$DE02-$DE0F - Clockport memory area (when enabled)

$DF10 - MMC SPI transfer register, a byte written is sent to the card &
response from the card is read here.

$DF11 - MMC control register

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    0 = MMC BIOS enabled, 1 = MMC BIOS disabled.  Enabling  MMC  BIOS
              sets ROM banking to the last 64Kb bank.
         1    0 = card selected, 1 = card not selected. This bit also  controls
              the green activity LED.

$DF12 - MMC status register

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    0 = SPI ready, 1 = SPI busy (read)
                             1 = forbid ROM  write  accesses  (write).  Setting
                             this bit will disable writes  to  ROM  until  next
                             reset
         1  feedback of $DE00 bit 0 (GAME)
         2  feedback of $DE00 bit 1 (EXROM)
         3  0 = card inserted, 1 = no card inserted
         4  0 = card write enabled, 1 = card write disabled
         5  EEPROM DATA line /  DDR  register.  Setting  DATA  to  "1"  enables
            reading data bit from EEPROM at this position.
         6  0 = RR compatibility mode, 1 = Extended mode
            Selecting RR compatibility mode limits RAM  to  32Kb  and  disables
            writes  to  extended  banking  register.  Selecting  Extended  mode
            enables full RAM banking and enables Nordic Power mode in RR mode.
         7  EEPROM CLK line

$DF13 - Extended banking register Can only be read/written to when bit 6
of $DF12 is 1

         bit  meaning

This cart has 32Kb of ROM and 8Kb of RAM, it uses I/O-1 as a mirror of
the last page of cart RAM. It has the following registers in the I/O-2
range:

ROM config register at $DF00 (can only be written to):

         bit  meaning
         ---  -------
         0    ?
         1    ? (write 1 to release freeze mode)
         2    ROM bank select
         3    write 1 to disable cartridge
         4-6  unused
         7    ?

Note: if bit0, bit1, bit7 are all 0, then ultimax mapping is selected
and RAM is enabled at ROML, otherwise if bit 0 is 0, then 16Kb mapping
is enabled, or if bit 0 is 1, then 8Kb mapping is enabled.

RAM config register at $DF01 (read/write):

If written value == last value - 1, then ultimax mapping is selected and
RAM is enabled at ROML, if written value == last value + 1, then ROM is
enabled at ROML and exrom is deasserted (switch to either 8k or 16k
mapping)

$DF02-$DFFF holds the last page of the first 8kb of the current bank.

When the cartridge is active, ultimax is enabled when the address being
accessed is is the $E000-$FFFF range, so the ROM is visible at $E000,
below is normal C64 RAM. The cart can be disabled by writing to either
I/O-1 or I/O-2 range.  When the freezer button is pressed, the cartridge
will be enabled and an NMI will be triggered.

When reading from the I/O-1 range the cart is enabled, when reading from
the I/O-2 range the cart is disabled.  When the freeze button is pressed
the ROM is mapped to both $8000-$9FFF and $E000-$FFFF.

This cart has 16Kb of ROM, mapped in at reset at $8000-$BFFF. The cart
is controled through a TPI at $DF80-$DF87:

         $DF80 - Port A Data
         $DF81 - Port B Data
         $DF82 - Port C Data
         $DF83 - Port A Direction

         $DF85 - Port C Direction
         $DF86 - Control register
         $DF87 - Active Interrupt register

The cart has a pass-through port and does the following at start-up:

   * Program starts after reset at $FFD3, and copies code from
     $FF36-$FFD2 to $0200-$029C (157 bytes)

   * Program continues at $021A, copies $A000-$BFFF from EPROM to RAM at
     $A000-$BFFF (8Kb), copies $E000-$FFFF from EPROM to RAM at
     $E000-$FFFF (8Kb), copies $AE62-$B461 from RAM to RAM at
     $C000-$C5FF (Magic Voice Code)

   * Jump to beginning of Magic Voice code at $C000

done is unknown.  Reading from the I/O-2 range will give you the last
page of the current ROM bank, and writing to it will disable the cart.

Accessing I/O-1 (the software uses $DE00 only it seems) disables
cartridge ROM. A reset enables 8K game mode and the ROM bank is mapped
to $8000.  A freeze causes ROM to be mapped to $8000.

This cart has 64Kb ROM (2 32Kb Eproms, mapped to $8000 and $A000 in 16Kb
Game Mode), and 32Kb RAM (mapped to $8000 and $A000 in 16K Game Mode).
The cart has 1 (write-only) bank control register which is located at
$DE80 and mirrored throughout the $DE80-$DEFF range:

         Bit 0: unused/don't care
         Bit 1: Bank select: 0=upper, 1=lower (not correct ?!)
         Bit 2: chip select 0
         Bit 3: chip select 1
         Bit 4: cartridge enable/disable: 0=enable, 1=disable
         Bits 5-7: unused/don't care

Chip select combinations of 0/1 are:
         00: Eprom "79"
         01: Eprom "ZS3"
         10: Ram
         11: empty space (reading returns VIC-II data)

note: on the original hardware "disabling" the cartridge by setting bit
4 of the control register does NOT prevent write accesses to the
cartridge RAM!. So to actually disable the RAM, it is suggested to write
$FF to the register.

This cart has 24Kb ROM (3 8Kb Eproms)

         reading io1:
         - switches to 16k game mode
         - first eprom mapped to 8000 (ROML)
         - second eprom mapped to A000 (ROMH)

         writing io1:
         - switches to ultimax mode _only_:
           - if 0xc000 > address >= 0x8000
           - if address >= 0xe000
           (meaning 0x0000-0x7fff and 0xc000-0xdfff gives normal c64 ram/io)
         - first eprom mapped to 8000 (ROML)
         - third eprom mapped to e000 (ROMH)

Cartridge hardware is designed around a 128Kb ROM (PROM or Mask ROM)
which is divided into 16 banks each of 8Kb.  When adressing the onboard
bank-switching logic the requested ROM bank is mapped at address range
$8000-$9fff (8Kb)

The cartridge PCB layout was cost-optimized for mass-production
purposes.

The address-/data-lines and bank-switching logic uses the closest
address-/data-lines with shortest and most direct path/distance in order
to avoid too much PCB re-routing and keep production costs as low as
possible.

This means that the respective address-/data-lines from the cartridge
port may not necessarily connect with the corresponding
address-/data-line of the ROM according to the official specs of the
ROM.

This has over the years given some headaches and invalid dumps when
cartridge dumpers that wanted to dump the cartridge contents by
de-soldering the ROM and dumping it using an EPROM programmer/reader.

The image extracted from such an operation would need transformation
according to the actual cartridge PCB re-routing of address-/data-lines.
Alternatively one can make an adapter that implements this applied
re-routing of the address-/data-lines.

This mass-production cost optimization also results in an obscured
bank-switching address pattern/values more info on that later.

[HWrev1]: The original "Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] is labeled "HUGO Copyright
1990" on both sides of the PCB. PCB production date is stamped on the
back og PCB in the format: "YYMM" 1Mbit 27C010 EPROM or PROM (typical
Atmel) "Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] contains the following discrete logic IC
components: 74LS00N (DIP) and 74LS237N (DIP) DIP pitch (pin spacing)
2.54mm (0.1 inch) Assembly/production facilities: Philips, Strandlodsvej
(Amager), Copenhagen, Denmark

[HWrev1] Bank-switching pattern: In order for the rom contents to appear
as a continuous memory layout the following ROM bank-switching pattern
must be applied by writing to adress 0xDE00: Cartridge bank-switching
values: 00 80 10 90 20 a0 30 b0 40 c0 50 d0 60 e0 70 f0 Writing the
bank-switch value to any address in address-range 0xDE00-0xDEFF will
work.

[HWrev2]: Revised PCB [HWrev2] for SMD mount is labeled "SO-A4-1" on
both sides of PCB. 1Mbit Mask ROM (SOIC-32) PCB contains the following
discrete logic SMD IC components: 74HCT02T (SOIC-14) and 74HCT174T
(SOIC-16) SOIC (pitch) pin spacing 1.27mm (SMD mounted)
Assembly/production facilities: Sono Press, Germany.

[HWrev2] Uses alternative bank-switching pattern: Writing *ANY* value to
address 0xDE0y (offset y) will select ROM bank y Cartridge still has 16
banks and the lower four bits in the address selects the right bank.
Hence the valid address range is 0xDE00-0xDE0F

the following is a quick overview of how the cartridge works, as its a
bit unusual and different from most other cartridges:

     - 27256 EPROM (32k)
     - 7430 TTL
     - MC6821
     - 1 button (reset)

     rom bank 0x00 - 0x03 (0x04) 8192* 4 32k mapped to e000
     MC6821 registers mapped to io2 at dfc0..dfc4

     - press reset and hold delete to get the main menu
     - press reset and hold control to skip cbm80 check
       (dont start additional cartridge)

     - press RESTORE, then...
       - left arrow, return  show disk directory
       - delete, 1           load"*" from disk, run
       - f1/f2               ? (disk stuff?)
       - f3/f4               ? (disk stuff?)
       - f5/f6, q            enter monitor
       - f7/f8, 2            show drive error channel
       - control, cursor     back to basic

       - type "help" in basic to get a list of available commands

     *** MC6821 Port usage

     Port A (parallel cable to floppy drive):
     dfc0 port a ddr
     dfc1 port a (in/out)

     Port B (controls banking)
     dfc2 port b ddr ($7f)
     dfc3 port b (out)

     bit3    1 = rom at $e000 enabled, 0 = cartridge disabled
     bit1-2  rom bank number
     bit0    ?

This cartridge type is very similar to the Magic Desk cart type: ROM
memory is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF. Bank
switching is done by writing the bank number to $DE00.

         bit 0-2   bank number
         bit 3     exrom latch (1 = cart disabled until reset or powercycle)

16.12 The PSID image format for ripped SID tunes
================================================

This section describes the SID file format used for SID tunes in the
HVSC (High Voltage SID Collection - http://hvsc.de).  It is based mostly
on Michael Schwendt's document that describes the file format and the
PSID v2NG extensions described by Simon White and Dag Lem and was
further extended by Wilfred Bos (PSID v3/v4, RSID v3/v4) and LaLa
(assembled most of the following text) and last not least tweaked a bit
by Groepaz to fit into the VICE documentation.

The original documentation maintained by the HVSC team can be found
here:
<http://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt>

SID files use the .sid file extension.

Since PSID v2 is simply an extension of PSID v1, PSID v2NG is an
extension of PSID v2, RSID is a restricted version of PSID v2NG, PSID
v3/v4 and RSID v3/v4 are extentions of PSID v2NG and RSID v2, all of the
formats are discussed together below.  RSID in specific is discussed in
detail under the 'magicID' field description.

The information presented here targets programmers or other people with
reasonable background.  It is not suitable for newbies who have never
before used a machine code monitor, a disassembler, or a hexadecimal
editor.

16.12.1 The SID file header v1
------------------------------

The detailed structure of the SID header looks like the following.
Header offsets are in hexadecimal notation.  Other integer values are
decimal unless explicitly marked otherwise.  Any stored integer values
are in big-endian format:

     +00    magicID: ``PSID'' or ``RSID''

This is a four byte long ASCII character string containing the value
0x50534944 or 0x52534944.  'RSID' (Real SID) denotes that the file
strictly requires a true Commodore-64 environment to run properly.
'PSID' files will generally run trouble-free on older PlaySID and
libsidplay1 based emulators, too.

Some words about the Real C64 SID file format (RSID):

The RSID format was designed to contain tunes that are not PlaySID
compatible, but strictly require a real C64 environment to run.  Tunes
that are multi-speed and/or contain samples and/or use additional
interrupt sources or do busy looping will cause older SID emulators to
lock up or play very wrongly (if at all).

By using the name RSID for such rips all existing SID emulators will
reject these tunes safely until they can be upgraded to cope with the
additional requirements.

Due to the nature of these tunes, every effort must be made to make sure
they are directly runnable on an actual C64 computer.  As such the tunes
will only be presented with the default C64 power-on environment and
expected to configure and use all hardware appropriately.

RSID is based on PSIDv2NG with the following modifications:

   * magicID = RSID
   * version = 2, 3 and 4 only
   * loadAddress = 0 (reserved)
   * playAddress = 0 (reserved)
   * speed = 0 (reserved)
   * psidSpecific flag is called C64BASIC flag

The above fields MUST be checked and if any differ from the above then
the tune MUST be rejected.  The definitions above will force tunes to
contain proper hardware configuration code and install valid interrupt
handlers.

See section "The SID file environment" below for the default C64
power-on environment for each SID file format.

     +04    WORD version

Available version number can be 0001, 0002, 0003 or 0004.  Headers of
version 2, 3 and 4 provide additional fields.  RSID and PSID v2NG files
must have 0002, 0003 or 0004 here.

     +06    WORD dataOffset

This is the offset from the start of the file to the C64 binary data
area.  Because of the fixed size of the header, this is either 0x0076
for version 1 and 0x007C for version 2, 3 and 4.

     +08    WORD loadAddress

The C64 memory location where to put the C64 data.  0 means the data are
in original C64 binary file format, i.e.  the first two bytes of the
data contain the little-endian load address (low byte, high byte).  This
must always be true for RSID files.  Furthermore, the actual load
address must NOT be less than $07E8 in RSID files.

You must be absolutely sure what to enter here.  There is no way to
detect automatically whether the first two bytes in a C64 data file are
meant to be a load address or some arbitrary bytes of code or data.
Unless your C64 file is not a normal binary file and thus has no load
address in front, you need not enter anything else than 0 here.  The SID
tune will not play if you specify a load address which is present in the
C64 file already.

Normal C64 binary data files have a load address in their first two
bytes, so they can be loaded to a pre-defined destination address by
executing LOAD"FILE",8,1, for instance.  If a load address is explicitly
specified in the sidtune info file, some sidtune converters and
utilities conjecture that the C64 data don't have a load address in
their first two bytes.  Hence, the explicit load address from the info
file is moved in front of the C64 data to create a valid C64 binary file
which can be easily loaded on a C64, too.  If that C64 file were to be
saved, it would contain two superfluous data bytes at offset 2 if an
original load address had been in the first two bytes of the old file.
This process of adding a duplicate load address can be repeated.  The
file loader strips off the first two bytes (the used load address) and
puts the rest of the file contents (including the now obsolete load
address at file offset 2) into memory.  If the new load address is the
same than the old one the two added bytes cause the whole data to be
displaced by two bytes, which most likely results in malfunctioning
code.  Also, superfluous bytes in memory then can confuse disassemblers
which start at the beginning of the file or memory buffer.

     +0A    WORD initAddress

The start address of the machine code subroutine that initializes a
song, accepting the contents of the 8-bit 6510 Accumulator as the song
number parameter.  0 means the address is equal to the effective load
address.

In RSID files initAddress must never point to a ROM area ($A000-$BFFF or
$D000-$FFFF) or be lower than $07E8.  Also, if the C64 BASIC flag is
set, initAddress must be 0.

     +0C    WORD playAddress

The start address of the machine code subroutine that can be called
frequently to produce a continuous sound.  0 means the initialization
subroutine is expected to install an interrupt handler, which then calls
the music player at some place.  This must always be true for RSID
files.

     +0E    WORD songs

The number of songs (or sound effects) that can be initialized by
calling the init address.  The minimum is 1.  The maximum is 256.

     +10    WORD startSong

The song number to be played by default.  This value is optional.  It
often specifies the first song you would hear upon starting the program
is has been taken from.  It has a default of 1.

     +12    LONGWORD speed

This is a 32 bit big endian number.

For version 1 and 2 and for version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific
flag (+76) set, the 'speed' should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune
number, i.e.  bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1.  If there are more
than 32 tunes, the speed specified for tune 32 is the same as tune 1,
for tune 33 it is the same as tune 2, etc.

For version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific flag (+76) cleared, the
'speed' should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune
number, i.e.  bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1.  If there are more
than 32 tunes, the speed specified for tune 32 is also used for all
higher numbered tunes.

For all version counts:

   * A 0 bit specifies vertical blank interrupt (50Hz PAL, 60Hz NTSC),
     and a 1 bit specifies CIA 1 timer interrupt (default 60Hz).
   * Surplus bits in 'speed' should be set to 0.
   * For RSID files 'speed' must always be set to 0.

Note that if 'play' = 0, the bits in 'speed' should still be set for
backwards compatibility with older SID players.  New SID players running
in a C64 environment will ignore the speed bits in this case.

WARNING: This field does not work in PlaySID for Amiga like it was
intended, therefore the above is a redefinition of the original 'speed'
field in SID v2NG! See also the 'clock' (video standard) field described
below for 'flags'.

     +16    ``<name>''
     +36    ``<author>''
     +56    ``<released>'' (once known as ``<copyright>'')

These are 32 byte long ASCII character strings.  Upon evaluating the
header, these fields may hold a character string of 32 bytes which is
not zero terminated.  For less than 32 characters the string should be
zero terminated.  The maximum number of available free characters is 32.

     +76    <data>

Version 1 of the SID header is complete at this point.  The binary C64
data starts here.

16.12.2 The SID file header v2, v3 and v4
-----------------------------------------

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the header incorporates the v1 header fields and
provides additional fields.  Some of these are actually v2NG, v3 or v4
specific - those are noted below.

     +76    WORD flags

This is a 16 bit big endian number containing the following bitfields:

   * Bit 0 specifies format of the binary data (musPlayer): 0 = built-in
     music player, 1 = Compute!'s Sidplayer MUS data, music player must
     be merged.

If this bit is set, the appended binary data are in Compute!'s Sidplayer
MUS format, and does not contain a built-in music player.  An external
player machine code must be merged to replay such a sidtune.

   * Bit 1 specifies whether the tune is PlaySID specific, e.g.  uses
     PlaySID samples (psidSpecific): 0 = C64 compatible, 1 = PlaySID
     specific (PSID v2NG, v3, v4) 1 = C64 BASIC flag (RSID)

This is a v2NG and RSID specific field.

PlaySID samples were invented to facilitate playback of C64 volume
register samples with the original Amiga PlaySID software.  PlaySID
samples made samples a reality on slow Amiga hardware with a player that
was updated only once a frame.

Unfortunately, converting C64 volume samples to PlaySID samples means
that they can no longer be played on a C64, and furthermore the
conversion might potentially break the non-sample part of a tune if the
timing between writes to the SID registers is at all altered.  This
follows from the ADSR bugs in the SID chip.

Today, the speed of common hardware and the sophistication of the SID
players is such that there is little need for PlaySID samples.  However,
with all the PlaySID sample PSIDs in existence there's a need to
differentiate between SID files containing only original C64 code and
PSID files containing PlaySID samples or having other PlaySID specific
issues.  As stated above, bit 1 in 'flags' is reserved for this purpose.

Since RSID files do not have the need for PlaySID samples, this flag is
used for a different purpose: tunes that include a BASIC executable
portion will be played (with the BASIC portion executed) if the C64
BASIC flag is set.  At the same time, initAddress must be 0.

   * Bits 2-3 specify the video standard (clock): 00 = Unknown, 01 =
     PAL, 10 = NTSC, 11 = PAL and NTSC.

This is a v2NG specific field.

As can be seen from the 'speed' field, it is not possible to specify
NTSC C64 playback.  This is unfortunate, since the different clock
speeds means that a tune written for the NTSC C64 will be slightly
detuned if played back on a PAL C64.  Furthermore, NTSC C64 tunes driven
by a vertical blank interrupt have to be converted to use the CIA 1
timer to fit into this scheme.  This can cause severe problems, as the
NTSC refresh rate is once every 17045 cycles, while the CIA 1 timer A is
latched with 17095 cycles.  Apart from the difference in timing itself,
the SID ADSR bugs can actually break the tune.

The 'clock' (video standard) field was introduced to circumvent this
problem.

   * Bits 4-5 specify the SID version (sidModel): 00 = Unknown, 01 =
     MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

This is a v2NG specific field.

   * Bits 6-7 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the second SID: 00 =
     Unknown, 01 = MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

If bits 6-7 are set to Unknown then the second SID will be set to the
same SID model as the first SID.

This is a v3 specific field.

   * Bits 8-9 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the third SID: 00 =
     Unknown, 01 = MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

If bits 8-9 are set to Unknown then the third SID will be set to the
same SID model as the first SID.

This is a v4 specific field.

The MOS6581 and the MOS8580 have three notable differences.  First,
combined waveforms are generally louder on a MOS8580, to the extent that
some combinations that are clearly audible on a MOS8580 are completely
silent on a MOS6581.  Second, the internal DC levels in the MOS8580 are
so small that software or hardware tricks must be used to play volume
samples.  Third, the MOS8580 analog filter has totally different
characteristics from the MOS6581 analog filter.

To ensure that music specifically written for one of the two SID
versions can be played back correctly, bits 4-9 in 'flags' are used as
stated above.

   * Bits 10-15 are reserved and should be set to 0.

     +78    BYTE startPage (relocStartPage)

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number.  If 'startPage' is 0, the SID file is clean,
i.e.  it does not write outside its data range within the driver ranges.
In this case the largest free memory range can be determined from the
start address and the data length of the SID binary data.  If
'startPage' is 0xFF, there is not even a single free page, and driver
relocation is impossible.  Otherwise, 'startPage' specifies the start
page of the single largest free memory range within the driver ranges.
For example, if 'startPage' is 0x1E, this free memory range starts at
$1E00.

     +79    BYTE pageLength (relocPages)

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the number of free pages after
'startPage'.  If 'startPage' is not 0 or 0xFF, 'pageLength' is set to
the number of free pages starting at 'startPage'.  If 'startPage' is 0
or 0xFF, 'pageLength' must be set to 0.

The relocation range indicated by 'startPage' and 'pageLength' should
never overlap or encompass the load range of the C64 data.  For RSID
files, the relocation range should also not overlap or encompass any of
the ROM areas ($A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) or the reserved memory area
($0000-$03FF).

     +7A    BYTE secondSIDAddress

This is a v3 specific field.  For v2NG, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the second SID. It
specifies the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42
for $D420 to $FE for $DFE0).  Only even values are valid.  Ranges
$00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and $80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid.  Any
invalid value means that no second SID is used, like $00.

     +7B    BYTE thirdSIDAddress

This is a v4 specific field.  For v2NG and v3, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the third SID. It
specifies the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42
for $D420 to $FE for $DFE0).  Only even values are valid.  Ranges
$00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and $80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid.  Any
invalid value means that no third SID is used, like $00.  The address of
the third SID cannot be the same as the second SID.

     +7C    <data>

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the SID header ends here.  This offset is the
start of the binary C64 data.  See also 'loadAddress' for what the first
2 bytes of 'data' might indicate.

16.12.3 The SID file environment
--------------------------------

Before the data of a SID file is loaded in memory of a C64, certain
addresses and chips must be initialized in order to play the SID tune
correctly.

For RSID and PSID files the following address must be set:

$02A6                  depending on the PAL/NTSC flag in the SID file
                       header, it is set to 0x01 for PAL and set to
                       0x00 for NTSC.

The default C64 environment for PSID files is as follows:

VIC                    IRQ set to any raster value less than 0x100.
                       Enabled when speed flag is 0, otherwise
                       disabled.
CIA 1 timer A          set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC)
                       with the counter running.  IRQs active when
                       speed flag is 1, otherwise IRQs are disabled.
Other timers           disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.

When the init and play addresses are called the bank register value must
be written for every call and the value is calculated as follows:

     if   address < $A000  -> 0x37 // I/O, Kernal-ROM, Basic-ROM
     else address < $D000  -> 0x36 // I/O, Kernal-ROM
     else address >= $E000 -> 0x35 // I/O only
     else                  -> 0x34 // RAM only

The default C64 environment for RSID files is as follows:

VIC                    IRQ set to raster 0x137, but not enabled.
CIA 1 timer A          set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC)
                       with the counter running and IRQs active.
Other timers           disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.
Bank register          0x37

   * A side effect of the bank register is that init MUST NOT be located
     under a ROM/IO memory area (addresses $A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF)
     or outside the load image.

   * Since every effort needs to be made to run the tune on a real C64
     the load address of the image MUST NOT be set lower than $07E8.

   * If the C64 BASIC flag is set, the value at $030C must be set with
     the song number to be played (0x00 for song 1).

19.1 VICE home page
===================

You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE home page:

     <http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net>

VICE has moved its source repository to public services provided by
SourceForge.  You can find it at
     <http://sf.net/projects/vice-emu>.

We would like to thank the SourceForge staff for that help.

If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages _first_; it
is possible that the problem you encountered has already been fixed with
a newer version.


File: vice.info,  Node: Sending feedback,  Next: Contributing,  Prev: Home page,  Up: Contacts

19.2 How to send feedback
=========================

Before contacting us, have a look at this manual and see if your
question is answered there.  Keep in mind that we work on VICE in our
spare-time, so the more time we don't need to answer the same questions
over and over again, the more time we have to improve the emulation
itself.  On the other hand, that does not mean that you should not
contact us, especially if you find bugs or have suggestions which might
improve the emulation.

Bug reports, suggestions, support requests should be directed to the
SourceForge trackers at

   * <https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/bugs/>.

This way, you, the users, and we, the developers, can track what has
been reported and what has been already fixed.  Ideally, also sent the
report to the mailing address of the Vice team at

   * VICE Mailing List (<vice-emu-mail@lists.sourceforge.net>) for all
     general questions, bug reports, suggestions.

You can also contact (some of) us on IRC, at #vice-dev on freenode.

It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but
please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the team.

   * Please put the word 'VICE' _in all capitals_ in your subject line
     (e.g., 'VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail splitting
     and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally deleted,
     forgotten or lost.

   * Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  Be patient
     when your mail does not show up on the mailing list - it is
     moderated manually.  Once your mail shows up you should be approved
     and be able to send mail without further delay.

   * Please don't send _any_ binaries without asking first.

   * Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
     bug or a problem you cannot solve:

        * the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);
        * the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
          from the VICE home page: <http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net>);
        * the 'comp.emulators.cbm' and 'comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
          you should read::).

   * When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
     describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
     also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating system
     you are using as well as the version of it.

   * Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
     your PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To
     transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
     (<http://sta.c64.org/sc.html>) on DOS, and OpenCBM
     (<http://www.trikaliotis.net/opencbm>) on Windows and Linux.  And
     no, you cannot read C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

   * Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
     Internet.  It should be very easy to find them using your favourite
     search engine.

   * Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
     really don't know.

   * Please write in English.

In any case, we would be _really_ glad to receive your comments about
VICE. We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read all of
it.

Thanks!

19.3 How to contribute
======================

If you want to make a major contribution, please _ask_ first.  It has
already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do _not_ want anybody to waste time.

If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is relative
to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

   * Make sure you are giving us a diff against the latest Subversion
     trunk version of VICE. Get it with the command:
          'svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk vice-src'
   * send a unified diff file against the trunk version of VICE (see
     above bullet point) by using the command: 'svn diff' inside of the
     SVN workspace you checked out before.

   * If you cannot use SVN for one or the other reason, send a unified
     diff file containing all the changes you have made 'diff -u';
     please don't use plain 'diff'), as it adds much work for us to get
     it working;
   * GNU-style 'ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes you
     have made (look at the 'ChangeLog's provided with the original VICE
     sources for an example).

Preferably post your patch on the tracker:
<https://sourceforge.net/p/vice-emu/patches/>.

This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.  But
notice from experience it will take at least a full year of continuous
work to write a well working and stable port.

19.4 Interesting newsgroups
===========================

There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

   * 'comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
     machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

   * 'comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
     8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually
     use original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about
     emulation here).

   * 'comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.


File: vice.info,  Node: FAQs you should read,  Prev: Newsgroups,  Up: Contacts

19.5 FAQs you should read
=========================

We recommend reading the 'comp.emulators.cbm' and 'comp.sys.cbm' FAQs,
which are posted regularly on the corresponding newsgroups and are also
available via FTP from <ftp://rtfm.mit.edu>.
